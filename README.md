Hello! I have been doing full-stack application development since I was young. I still strive to learn and also to apply my valuable knowledge.

I am also into game development and I have been using Unity, Godot, and Three.js to build interactive stuff.

I have worked at quite a few startups and gained valuable knowledge regarding how to operate a project.

## I am currently looking for job opportunities. I can do almost anything for you.
